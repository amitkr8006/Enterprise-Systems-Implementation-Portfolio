# MS809 Enterprise Systems Implementation Portfolio

This project is a complete enterprise-systems portfolio created for MS809 (Enterprise Systems Implementation). It combines three connected workstreams: (1) an ERP failure case study with a recovery blueprint, (2) a cloud ERP deep-dive on Oracle NetSuite with module and case analysis, and (3) an individual assessment linking operating models to enterprise IT requirements and CRM ethics. Together, these deliver a practical view of how enterprise systems are selected, implemented, governed, and improved.

## Portfolio Objectives
- Analyse why ERP programmes fail and how to recover them using structured governance, requirements, testing, and change management controls.
- Understand how a modern cloud ERP platform (Oracle NetSuite) delivers value across key business processes such as order-to-cash and manufacturing.
- Explain how enterprise operating models shape IT architecture and integration needs, and evaluate CRM processes, implementation challenges, and ethical responsibilities.

## Workstream 1: UK Public-Sector ERP Failure Diagnosis & Recovery Blueprint (Group)
This workstream analyses a failed ERP implementation in a UK public-sector organisation. It identifies critical success factors (CSFs) that were missed, categorises common ERP risks (technical, schedule, operational, business, organisational), and explains root causes such as weak process mapping, incomplete stakeholder representation, contract rigidity, late discovery of functional gaps, inadequate testing/UAT, and data migration challenges.

**Recovery blueprint highlights:**
- Rebaseline requirements through stakeholder workshops and sign-off; establish a design baseline as a single source of truth.
- Strengthen governance (steering committee, ownership, decision rights) and enforce scope/change control.
- Improve integration testing, UAT discipline, and data migration planning with involvement from all business units.
- Drive adoption using structured training, communication, and KPI-based monitoring.

## Workstream 2: Oracle NetSuite Cloud ERP Deep-Dive (Group)
This workstream explains Oracle NetSuite’s cloud-first SaaS ERP positioning and how it creates operational value, especially for order-intensive and manufacturing environments. It covers SaaS advantages (scalability, reduced IT overhead, automatic updates, remote accessibility) and compares NetSuite’s role within a competitive ERP landscape.

**Module value highlights:**
- **Order Management (Order-to-Cash):** omnichannel order processing, real-time inventory visibility, automated fulfilment/billing workflows, and integrated financial reporting.
- **Manufacturing:** integrated manufacturing + inventory + finance, shop-floor execution support, traceability, and configurable manufacturing models aligned to complexity.

A real adoption case is used to connect features to outcomes such as better visibility, workflow unification, automation, forecasting, and scalability.

## Workstream 3: Enterprise Operating Models + CRM (Individual)
This workstream links business structure to enterprise IT strategy by comparing operating models (diversification, coordination, replication, unification) and explaining how each influences process standardisation, integration depth, and system design needs.

It also analyses CRM by:
- Differentiating CRM and ERP roles in the organisation
- Explaining CRM process types (delivery, support, analytical)
- Highlighting implementation challenges (adoption, data quality, integration)
- Addressing ethics and privacy responsibilities in customer data use (compliance mindset and responsible practice)

---

## Outcome
A cohesive enterprise systems portfolio that connects implementation realities (failure patterns and recovery controls), platform capabilities (cloud ERP value across processes), and strategic alignment (operating models, CRM, ethics). It demonstrates structured reasoning, stakeholder-focused thinking, and practical recommendations applicable to real ERP/CRM programmes.
